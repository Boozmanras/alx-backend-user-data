# ALX Backend User Data Project

This project covers key concepts for handling and securing user data, including data filtering, password encryption, and validation. Each module focuses on implementing secure methods to protect sensitive information while ensuring functionality meets coding standards.

## Project Overview

1. **Logging User Data**
   Implements filtering techniques to mask sensitive data in logs, ensuring user privacy.

2. **Password Hashing and Verification**
   Provides secure functions for hashing passwords with `bcrypt` and verifying user credentials.

3. **Data Management and Filtering**
   Demonstrates efficient ways to handle personal data while maintaining data integrity and adhering to security practices.

## File Structure

- `filtered_logger.py`: Contains methods to filter and redact sensitive information in logs.
- `encrypt_password.py`: Defines functions to hash passwords and verify password authenticity.
- `main.py`: Example usage scripts to demonstrate password hashing and validation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7
- **Packages**: `bcrypt`

## Code Standards

This project follows `pycodestyle` (version 2.5) for code formatting, and all functions and modules are documented with type annotations.

## Usage

Each module can be imported and used independently based on the required functionality. Refer to specific module docstrings for detailed descriptions and example usage.
